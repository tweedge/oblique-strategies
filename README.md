# Oblique Strategies (for Security)

A very simple [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) shuffler.

TBD: ... with my custom deck of cards, remixed to promote [lateral thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking) in my field of work: cybersecurity.

Available here: [https://oblique.tweedge.net/](https://oblique.tweedge.net/)

### Instructions

Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's earliest decks included this instruction:

> These cards evolved from our separate observations on the principles underlying what we were doing. Sometimes they were recognized in retrospect (intellect catching up with intuition), sometimes they were identified as they were happening, sometimes they were formulated.
> 
> They can be used as a pack (a set of possibilities being continuously reviewed in the mind) or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation. In this case, the card is trusted even if its appropriateness is quite unclear. They are not final, as new ideas will present themselves, and others will become self-evident.

### Credits

Obviously, Brian Eni and Peter Schmidt for coming up with the concept. Need a physical copy of the original Oblique Strategies? [Support the original creators!](https://www.enoshop.co.uk/product/oblique-strategies.html)

Code:

* The design and source code for this site is forked [oblique-tab](https://github.com/wookiehangover/oblique-tab) by [wookiehangover](https://github.com/wookiehangover), then reduced to the bare minimum.
* `oblique-tab` depends on the [oblique-strategies](https://github.com/ceejbot/oblique-strategies/tree/master) Node module by [ceejbot](https://github.com/ceejbot), which I've cloned directly to this repository and tweaked to be browser-only.
